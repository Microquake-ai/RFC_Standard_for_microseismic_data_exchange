## Waveform Compression

To maximize portability and minimize bandwidth and storage requirements a waveforms compression scheme must be part of the format definition. 

There is always a tradeoff between reading speed and the compression level. The more compress a waveform is the slower reading it becomes. However, when considering data transfer, compression may actually result in gains in how fast the data can be accessed.
