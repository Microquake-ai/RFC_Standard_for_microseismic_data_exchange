## Executive Summary

This purpose of the RFC is to seek comments and suggestion regarding a proposed format for the exchange of microseismic data. The focus is on microseismic data collected by in-mine monitoring system, however, the proposed format is suited for any kind of microseismic data expressed in local coordinate system. 

The scope of the exchange format encompasses four types of data including the waveforms, the catalogs and system information and grids. The proposed format exploits versatile and powerful formats broadly adopted by the seismology community. The table below 


To facilitate the adoption of the format and the manipulation of seismological objects, we are releasing the $\mu$quake (micro-quake) library, an open source Python API built on top of Obspy.
