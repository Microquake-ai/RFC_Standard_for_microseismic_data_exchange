## Proposed Event Classes
### Overview
Uniformity and portability can only be achieved if the event classification is constrained to a series of classes broad enough to encompass most situation and event types encountered, but not so large that it become ambiguous. 

If simplicity is the objective, the classification could be limited to the following three categories: 
- seismic event;
- blast; and 
- noise. 

That would, however, be too reductionist and lead to ambiguity. The list suggested below is quite comprehensive, and from experience, encompass almost all event types that can be recorded by a mine $\mu$seismic monitoring system. 
| Seismic Event
| Suggested Event Types                 | Description                                             |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| earthquake/large event               | Tectonic earthquake or very large events recorded by national seismograph network|
| seismic event                        | Mining induced seismic event  |
| offsite event                        | Used for a seismic event happening at, for instance, a nearby operation|
| rock burst                          | Sudden and violent release of built-up stress within the rock.| |fall of ground/rockfall              | Dislodgement and downward movement of rock or ground. |  




| raise bore                          | Mechanical method for drilling between levels in mines.                |
| duplicate                            | Event already recorded or identified; redundant entry.                 |
| unknown                              | Event type or origin not determined or identified.                     |
