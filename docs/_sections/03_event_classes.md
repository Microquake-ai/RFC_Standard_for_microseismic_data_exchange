## Proposed Event Classes
### Overview
Uniformity and portability can only be achieved if the event classification is constrained to a series of classes broad enough to encompass most situation and event types encountered, but not so large that it become ambiguous. 

If simplicity is the objective, the classification could be limited to the following three categories: 
- seismic event;
- blast; and 
- noise. 

That would, however, be too reductionist and lead to ambiguity. The list suggested below is quite comprehensive, and from experience, encompass almost all event types that can be recorded by a mine Î¼seismic monitoring system.

**Seismic Event**

| Suggested Event Types                 | Description                                             |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| *seismic event*                        | *Generic* Mining induced seismic event*  |
| earthquake/large event               | Tectonic earthquake or very large events recorded by national seismograph network|
| offsite event                        | Used for a seismic event happening at, for instance, a nearby operation|
| rock burst                          | Sudden and violent release of built-up stress within the rock.| 
|fall of ground/rockfall              | Dislodgement and downward movement of rock or ground. |  

**Blast**

| Suggested Event Types                 | Description                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *blast*                                | *Generic Blast: Controlled detonation for mining purposes.*             |
| blast sequence                       | Would apply for a series of blasts organized in a longer file containing the whole blast sequence.    |
| development blast                    | Specific type of blast for development               |
| production blast                     | Specific type of blast related to production      |
| far away blast/open pit blast        | Detonation outside underground mine, often in open pit operations or nearby quarry.     |
| offsite blast                        | Controlled explosion occurring outside the mine's premises. |
| paste firing                         | Detonation within cemented paste backfills.                 |
| calibration blast                    | Detonation to calibrate or test seismic monitoring equipment.|
| other blast/slashing                 | Miscellaneous detonations not fitting standard categories.   |
| mid-shift blast/slash blast          | Detonation conducted during a shift change or mid-shift.     |

**Noise**

| Suggested Event Types                 | Description                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *noise*									| *Generic Noise* |
| crusher noise                        | Sound from machinery crushing ore or rock.                             |
| orepass noise                        | Sound originating from ore movement in passes or chutes.               |
| drilling noise                       | Acoustic disturbance from drilling activities.                         |
| electrical noise                     | Interference from electrical sources or equipment.                     |
| scaling noise                        | Noise associated with removal of loose rock from mine walls or roof.   |
| mechanical noise                     | Sound from general mechanical operations or machinery.                 |
| test pulse                           | Controlled signal used to test or calibrate seismic equipment.         |
| unidentified noise/other noise       | Acoustic disturbances without clear origin or classification.          |
| raise bore                          | Mechanical method for drilling between levels in mines.                |             |
| unknown                              | Event type or origin not determined or identified.                     |

| duplicate                            | Event already recorded or identified; redundant entry.    |
| tap test/test                        | Controlled tapping or impact to test response of monitoring systems usually done during the installation and commissioning of the system to test the equipment.   |
