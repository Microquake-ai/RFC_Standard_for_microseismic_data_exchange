## Proposed Event Classes
Uniformity and portability can only be achieved if the event classification is constrained to a series of classes broad enough to encompass most situation and event types encountered, but not so large that it become ambiguous. 

If simplicity is the objective, the classification could be limited to the following three categories: 
- seismic event;
- blast; and 
- noise. 

That would, however, be too reductionist and lead to ambiguity. The list suggested below is quite comprehensive, and from experience, encompass almost all event types that can be recorded by a mine $\mu$seismic monitoring system. 

| Suggested Event Types                 | Description              |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| earthquake/large event            |                         |
| seismic event                     |         |
| offsite event                     |                  |
| rock burst                        |                         |
| fall of ground/rockfall           |                    |
| blast                             |                          |
